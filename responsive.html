						<p>Failure is unimportant. It takes courage to make a fool of yourself</p>
						<p>A tramp, a gentleman, a poet, a dreamer, a lonely fellow, always hopeful of romance and adventure.</p>
						<p>The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish.</p>

						<p>To have faith is to trust yourself to the water. When you swim you don't grab hold of the water, because if you do you will sink and drown. Instead you relax, and float.</p>
